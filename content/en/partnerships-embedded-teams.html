  <p>
    Embedded Teams aim to change how your organization designs and delivers services through hands-on, co-creation with your teams. We coach by delivering with you, not for you. In other words, we're full-time coaches and consultants, not staff augmentation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our teams are staffed with experienced people holding practical knowledge in UX design, user research, software development, product management, operations (i.e. devops, change management, gov ops, etc.). Prior to and during their CDS tenure, they've shipped digital services at scale in the private sector and within government.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our services are free to other Government of Canada departments (i.e. we are <em>not</em> cost recoverable), but we <em>will</em> need access to your time, people, data, and service users AND an open mind to try new things.
  </p>

  <h2>What might we do with you?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Map out your service to understand user touchpoints, challenges, bottlenecks, etc.</li>
    <li>Redesign your web application, website, or interactions with users based on those users needs</li>
    <li>Introduce modern product and project management tactics</li>
    <li>Migrate to the cloud and adopt DevOps culture</li>
    <li>Revise your security processes to decrease risk and be helpful rather than just blindly blocking everything</li>
    <li>Hire or train your upcoming digital service team</li>
    <li>Examine how your org structure is impacting delivery</li>
    <li>Meet and get to know the users of your service</li>
    <li>Rescue a distressed service</li>
    <li>Make your services more accessible and inclusive</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What will we not do?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Code an app <em>for</em>, not with you</li>
    <li>(OTHER THINGS?)</li>
  </ul>

    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>
      The Department of Widgets Canada (or, Widgets Canada) wants to encourage gizmo buying for the betterment of society. They've decided to launch a grant program that gives money to families to purchase their first gizmo. They'd like to allow people to register for the Gizmo Grant online, but last time they did something like this for contraption grants, it went very poorly. The site went down often, users had trouble using it, and they wound up with an unmanagable backlog of grant applications and emails to process.
    </p>

    <p>
      Within WC, the program office and the IT group approach CDS to see if they can get some experts to help. CDS has a one hour intake meeting to understand the request. Then later that month, an Embedded Team conducts a discovery sprint to better understand the goals and challenges to delivery of the Gizmo Grant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The discovery report finds that the proposed website isn't accessible, may not be able to handle the traffic to it, and that the program and IT officer are having trouble working together. This is communicated back to Widgets Canada and CDS asks if they would like help working on one or more of these challenges. WC does want help, and agrees to CDS's conditions to provide program and IT individual contributors to work side-by-side with CDS and clear blockers. This simultaneously helps get new skills to the individual contributors and creates rapid progress against the program challenges.
    </p>
    <p>
      CDS's Embedded Team starts off working for 10-20 hours a week with Widgets (MORE COMING).

  <h2>How do Embedded Teams work?</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Intake:</strong> Either you contacted us or we contacted you, but either way we'll establish interest in partnering and on what service.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Discovery:</strong> We'll conduct a discovery sprint for a week or two to learn more about your service and how your organization is setup to deliver it. This will give us a better idea of if and how we can help, who we'd have to work with, and how to measure progress.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Decide how to partner:</strong> Based on the discovery sprint we'll decide whether or not we can meaningfully improve your service and ways of working. If so, we'll figure out how to work together longer. If not, we'll leave you with a recommendations report on how your service
      might be improved.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Co-create:</strong> Assuming we're working together longer, we'll start working side-by-side with your program and IT groups. This enables us to teach what we know in a hands-on way, and to ship improvements to your service iteratively.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>What do we need to work with you?</h2>
  <p>
    Currently, we have a small number of people to partner with departments. To make the best use of their time, we prioritize partners who have the following conditions around their service.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Readiness and willingness:</strong> Clear leadership on a service and an open mind to trying new methods, technologies, and org structures. Additionally, the ability to unblock commons barriers to trying new things.</li>
    <li><strong>Reach and impact:</strong> Your service is used by many people and/or very important to a vulnerable populations.</li>
    <li><strong>Priority of service:</strong> If a service is not a priority within your department, it's unlikely to get the buy-in to try new things.</li>
    <li><strong>Access:</strong> To department staff, leadership, and users of your service.</li>
    <li><strong>Participation:</strong> Since we're working with you, not building for you -- we'll need half-to-full-time participation of a cross functional set of staff. This is how we coach and help. This means empowering a small groups of folks across multiple groups that is empowered to make decisions and perform relevant actions.</li>
  </ul>
