  <p>
    Embedded Teams aim to change how your organization designs and delivers services through hands-on, co-creation with your teams. We coach by delivering with you, not for you. In other words, we're full-time coaches and consultants, not staff augmentation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our teams are staffed with experienced people holding practical knowledge in UX design, user research, software development, technical operations (i.e. devops), and product management. Prior to and during their CDS tenure, they've shipped digital services at scale in the private sector and within government.

  <h2>How do Embedded Teams work?</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Intake:</strong> Either you contacted us or we contacted you, but either way we'll establish interest in partnering and on what service.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Discovery:</strong> We'll conduct a discovery sprint for a week or two to learn more about your service and how your organization is setup to deliver it. This will give us a better idea of if and how we can help, who we'd have to work with, and how to measure progress.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Decide how to partner:</strong> Based on the discovery sprint we'll decide whether or not we can meaningfully improve your service. If so, we'll figure out how to work together longer. If not, we'll leave you with a recommendations report on how your service
      might be improved.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Co-create:</strong> Assuming we're working together longer, we'll start working side-by-side folks your program and IT groups to teach what we know in a hands-on way. Because our work is optimized to leave you and your team with new ways of working, co-creation is the optimal way of working here. 
    </li>
  </ol>

    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>
      The Department of Widgets Canada (or, Widgets Canada) wants to encourage gizmo buying for the betterment of society. They've decided to launch a grant program that gives money to families to purchase their first gizmo. They'd like to allow people to register for the Gizmo Grant online, but last time they did something like this for contraption grants, it went very poorly. The site went down often, users had trouble using it, and they wound up with an unmanagable backlog of grant applications and emails to process.
    </p>

    <p>
      Within WC, the program office and the IT group approach CDS to see if they can get some experts to help. CDS has a one hour intake meeting to understand the request. Then later that month, an Embedded Team conducts a discovery sprint to better understand the goals and challenges to delivery of the Gizmo Grant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The discovery report finds that the proposed website isn't accessible, may not be able to handle the traffic to it, and that the program and IT officer are having trouble working together. This is communicated back to Widgets Canada and CDS asks if they would like help working on one or more of these challenges. WC does want help, and agrees to CDS's conditions to provide program and IT individual contributors to work side-by-side with CDS and clear blockers. This simultaneously helps get new skills to the individual contributors and creates rapid progress against the program challenges.
    </p>
    <p>
      CDS's Embedded Team starts off working for 10-20 hours a week with Widgets (MORE COMING).
